# RadioactiveDecay
- Calculate the estimated time, remaining activity
- plot the radioactive decay and scheme for different nuclids
- GUI for easy application

# Explanation
- Choose a nuclid (e.g. F-18)
- Define the start activity in Bq (e.g. 100)
- Define the starting date and time, format: d/m/Y H:M:S (e.g. 01/01/2020 10:00:00)
- Define the ending date and time, format: d/m/Y H:M:S (e.g. 01/01/2020 10:50:00)

# Content
- Nuclids: ['C-11', 'N-13', 'O-15', 'F-18', 'Cu-62', 'Cu-64', 'Ga-68', 'Ge-68', 'Br-76', 'Rb-82', 'Zr-89', 'Tc-99m', 'I-124', 'I-125', 'I-131']
- nuclid specific half life and decay scheme as image
